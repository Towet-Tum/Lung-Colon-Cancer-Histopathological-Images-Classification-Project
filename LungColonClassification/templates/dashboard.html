        <p><strong>Doctor's Description:</strong> Following the diagnosis of lung cancer, a comprehensive treatment plan has been devised for Patient 1. The initial step involves surgical intervention to remove the localized tumor. This will be followed by a course of radiotherapy to ensure any remaining cancer cells are effectively targeted. Additionally, chemotherapy will be administered to address potential systemic spread. Our multidisciplinary team is committed to providing personalized care and support throughout this journey.</p>
